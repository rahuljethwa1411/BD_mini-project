Introduction:
India is home to the second largest road network in the world with a total road length of approximately 62.1 lakh kilometers. This massive network serves as the nation’s lifeline transporting over 64.5% of all goods within the country in addition to being the preferred option for move of over 90% of India’s passenger traffic. While roads remain synonymous with development and growth in the country, they have also been a nemesis for users with India also carrying the dubious distinction of leading the global tally of annual deaths and injuries on account of road accidents.

Dataset:

The dataset contains Road and Rail accidents that happened in India from 2001-2014.
These are the main questions that we are going to find out form this kernel:
Which state is most prone to Road Accidents
Does the number of accidents increasing per year
Which time (morning, evening, early morning etc.) is most deadly or prone to accidents.
These are few more questions that can be explore from this dataset :
Shift in the number of accidents in each state year wise.
Shift in the number of accidents in each time-range year wise.
